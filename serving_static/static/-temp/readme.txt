-temp file used to store images gathered before they are moved into people
the reason for temp file is because for 500 images to be downloaded it takes around 15 mins
it takes 30 seconds to move 500 files
this way the website updates in 30 seconds rather than 15 minitues
readme.txt add so that empty file can be added to git
